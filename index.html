Xerox Crypto (XRX) is a currency fonded by Wullie , Andrew Deeds, Lenrik and Rollingvolcanoe.
</p2>

<h2> How it works </h2>

<p2>
Xrx uses a custom algorithm developed by William Morrison that gives each block (list of transactins) a random hash. The transaction is sent out to the network of miners to prosses the 1 and 0 to convert them back into hexidecimal and then into prime number form and moving the block to a node(a pc that runs software to verify if the hash was real) and the added to the block chain. everything in this prosess will be encryped using a new encryption algorithm called XRX32
